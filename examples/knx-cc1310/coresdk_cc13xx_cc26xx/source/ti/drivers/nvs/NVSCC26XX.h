 *  @brief      Non-Volatile Storage driver for CC13XX/CC26XX devices.
 *
 *  ## Interrupt Latency During Flash Operations #
 *
 *  When writing or erasing flash, interrupts must be disabled to avoid
 *  executing code in flash while the flash is being reprogrammed. This
 *  constraint is handled by the driver. Application code does not need
 *  to safeguard against this.
 *
 *  Additionally, to avoid extremely large interrupt latencies that would be
 *  incurred if entire blocks were written with interrupts disabled, block
 *  writes to flash are broken into multiple smaller sizes.
 *
 *  Even with this scheme in place, latencies of roughly 64 microseconds will
 *  be incurred while flash is being written to.
 *
 *  A similar caveat applies to flash erase operations. Erasing an entire
 *  flash sector (the minimal amount that can be erased at a time) can take
 *  roughly 8 milliseconds. This entire operation must be performed with
 *  interrupts disabled. Here again, this requirement is met internally
 *  by the driver and flash region erases are performed one sector at a
 *  time to minimize this significant latency impact.
 *
 *  Care must be taken by the user to not perform flash write or erase
 *  operations during latency critical phases of an application. See the
 *  NVS_lock() and NVS_unlock() API descriptions for more information.
 *
 *  ## Maximum flash writes before erase #
 *
 *  On CC13XX & CC26XX memory rows can be 128 or 256 bytes in length; refer to
 *  the device datasheet for the exact size.  A maximum of 83 write operations
 *  can be performed on a memory row.  Once the limit is reached, the row must
 *  be erased before it is written to again. It is the developer's
 *  responsibility to ensure that this limit is not exceeded in their
 *  applications. The developer may also opt to use the third party SPIFFS
 *  library implementation supported by TIRTOS which does track writes.
 *
 *  \note The 83 write limit persists through device reset & power cycles.
 *  If 60 write operations were performed on a memory row & the device is
 *  reset; the page can still only be written to 23 more times before it must
 *  be erased.
 *
 *  A write "Scoreboard" can be enabled in this driver; the scoreboard keeps
 *  track of how many times a page has been written to.  It is provided as a
 *  debug tool to ensure the 83 write limit is not exceeded.  If a page is
 *  written to more than 83 times, the NVSCC26XX driver will spin forever.
 *  Each byte in the scoreboard corresponds to a memory page in the NVS region.
 *  The byte is incremented when the memory is written to & set to 0 when
 *  erased.
 *
 *  To enable the "scoreboard" the "NVSCC26XX_INSTRUMENTED" symbol must be
 *  defined when the driver is compiled.  Three new fields are added to the
 *  #NVSCC26XX_HWAttrs structure:
 *    * scoreboard - a buffer provided by the application where each byte
 *      represents how many times a page has been written to.
 *    * scoreboardSize - number of bytes in the scoreboard.
 *    * flashPageSize - number of bytes in a flash page (i.e. 128 or 256)
 *
 *  When configured correctly, the scoreboard can be viewed in a memory browser.
 *
 *  \note The scoreboard will only keep track of writes to flash within a
 *         NVS region using a NVS driver.  Writes performed outside the NVS
 *         region or without the NVS driver are untracked.
 *
 *  \note  The scoreboard is in RAM & will be lost on reset or power cycle.

 *  @internal @brief NVS function pointer table
 *
 *  'NVSCC26XX_fxnTable' is a fully populated function pointer table
 *  that can be referenced in the NVS_config[] array entries.
 *
 *  Users can minimize their application code size by providing their
 *  own custom NVS function pointer table that contains only those APIs
 *  used by the application.
 *
 *  An example of a custom NVS function table is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  //
 *  // Since the application does not use the
 *  // NVS_control(), NVS_lock(), and NVS_unlock() APIs,
 *  // these APIs are removed from the function
 *  // pointer table and replaced with NULL
 *  //
 *  const NVS_FxnTable myNVS_fxnTable = {
 *      NVSCC26XX_close,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSCC26XX_control(),
 *      NVSCC26XX_erase,

 *      NULL,     // remove NVSCC26XX_unlock(),

/*!
 *  @brief      NVSCC26XX hardware attributes
 *
 *  The NVSCC26XX hardware attributes define hardware specific settings
 *  for a NVS driver instance.
 *
 *  \note Care must be taken to ensure that the linker does not place application
 *  content (such as .text or .const) in the flash regions defined by the
 *  this hardware attributes structure.
 *
 *  For CCS and IAR tools, defining and reserving flash memory regions can
 *  be done entirely within the Board.c file. For GCC, additional content is
 *  required in the application's linker script to achieve the same
 *  result.
 *
 *  The example below defines a char array @p flashBuf. Preprocessor logic is
 *  used so that this example will work with either the TI, IAR or GCC tools.
 *  For the TI and IAR tools, pragmas are used to place @p flashBuf at the
 *  flash location specified by #NVSCC26XX_HWAttrs.regionBase.
 *
 *  For the GCC tool, the @p flashBuf array is placed into a named linker output
 *  section, @p .nvs. This section is defined in the application's linker
 *  script. The section placement command is carefully chosen to only RESERVE
 *  space for the @p flashBuf array, and not to actually initialize it during
 *  the application load process, thus preserving the content of flash.
 *
 *  Regardless of tool chain, the @p flashBuf array in the example below is
 *  placed at the @p NVS_REGIONS_BASE address and has an overall size of
 *  @p REGIONSIZE bytes. Theoretically, the memory reserved by @p flashBuf can
 *  be divided into four separate regions, each having a size of @p SECTORSIZE
 *  bytes. Each region must always be aligned to the flash sector size,
 *  @p SECTORSIZE. This example below shows two regions defined.
 *
 *  An array of two #NVSCC26XX_HWAttrs structures is defined. Each index
 *  of this structure defines a region of on-chip flash memory. Both regions
 *  utilize memory reserved by the @p flashBuf array. The two regions do not
 *  overlap or share the same physical memory locations. The two regions do
 *  however exist adjacent to each other in physical memory. The first
 *  region is defined as starting at the @p NVS_REGIONS_BASE address and has a
 *  size equal to the flash sector size, as defined by @p SECTORSIZE. The second
 *  region is defined as starting at (NVS_REGIONS_BASE + SECTORSIZE), that is,
 *  the @p NVS_REGIONS_BASE address offset by @p SECTORSIZE bytes. The second region
 *  has a size equal to (3 * SECTORSIZE) bytes. These regions together fully
 *  occupy @p REGIONSIZE bytes of physical on-chip flash memory as reserved by
 *  the @p flashBuf array.
 *
 *  @code
 *  #define NVS_REGIONS_BASE 0x1B000
 *  #define SECTORSIZE       0x1000
 *  #define REGIONSIZE       (SECTORSIZE * 4)

 *  //  The .nvs section enforces alignment on a sector boundary but may

 *
 *  If the write "scoreboard" is enabled, three new fields are added to the
 *  NVSCC26XX_HWAttrs structure:
 *    * scoreboard - a buffer provided by the application where each byte
 *      represents how many times a page has been written to.  It is important
 *      that this buffer be large enough such that there is a byte for each
 *      page of memory in the NVS region.  For example:
 *        - 64k NVS region
 *        - 256 byte page size
 *        - 64k / 256 = 256; the scoreboard buffer must be 256 bytes in length
 *
 *    * scoreboardSize - number of bytes in the scoreboard.
 *
 *    * flashPageSize - number of bytes in a flash page (i.e. 128 or 256)
