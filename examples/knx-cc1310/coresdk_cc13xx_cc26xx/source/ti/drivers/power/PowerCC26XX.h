 *
 * The JTAG subsystem on the CC26xx devices is automatically enabled after receiving
 * 8 pulses on the TCK pin. This will cause the device to draw more power in all
 * power modes (Active, Idle, Standby, Shutdown).
 * The ::PowerCC26XX_JTAG_PD_TURNED_ON power event will
 * let you know when this has happened outside of a debug session due to noise on the pin.
 * This allows the application to do a reset of the device when it's convenient in order
 * disable the JTAG subsystem and conserve power.
 *
 * In order to turn off the JTAG_PD the application should subscribe to this event.
 * In the callback function the application can call Power_shutdown() and
 * this will force a reset of the device.
 * Alternatively the the callback function can post another event so that the application can
 * reset the device when it's more convenient to do so.
 *
 * When Power_shutdown() is called when the JTAG subsystem is on,
 * the device will reset and branch to the flash image again,
 * only now with the JTAG_PD turned off, thus the excess power is gone.
 * The wakeup source as read through the SysCtrlResetSourceGet() will in this case
 * return RSTSRC_WAKEUP_FROM_SHUTDOWN.
 *
 * The power driver will, each time before entering standby, check to see if the
 * JTAG_PD has been turned on after boot. If so, it will notify all subscribers to the
 * ::PowerCC26XX_JTAG_PD_TURNED_ON event.
 * If the JTAG_PD was turned on during boot, which is the case when
 * using the debugger, the notification will NOT be sent even if the event is registered.
 * This is because when actively developing code with an IDE and emulator, the user typically
 * wants to be able to debug their code through standby without the device resetting.
 *
 * Summary of when the ::PowerCC26XX_JTAG_PD_TURNED_ON notification function will be called.
 *
 * | JTAG_PD state        | Notification function registered | Notification function called |
 * |----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------
 * | Off                  | Don't care                       | No
 * | Turned on during boot| Don't care                       | No
 * | Turned on after boot | No                               | No
 * | Turned on after boot | Yes                              | Yes
 *
 * \warning If the ::PowerCC26XX_JTAG_PD_TURNED_ON event is registered, and the notification
 * callback function calls Power_shutdown() it will not be possible to attach
 * an emulator to a running target. This is becasue the device will reset as soon as the
 * emulator turns on the JTAG_PD as part of the connect sequence.
 *
 *  Code snippet on how to register the notification and the callback function:
 *  @code
 *  void jtagPdTurnedOnCallbackFxn()
 *  {
 *      // Optionally save any critical application information
 *      // gracefullyShutdownApplication();
 *      // Call shutdown, this will reset device, and the application will reboot with JTAG_PD off.
 *      Power_shutdown(NULL, NULL);
 *      // Power_shutdown(...) should never return, device will reset.
 *  }
 *

 *      // Register "JTAG power domain turned on" notification function
 *      // Everytime the device is about to enter standby, the power driver will check
 *      // to see if the JTAG_PD has been turned on after boot. If so, the notification
 *      // function will be called before entering standby...

 *
 *  This is an agressive Power Policy, which considers active constraints,
 *  sleep state transition latencies, and time until the next scheduled
 *  work, and automatically transitions the device into the deepest sleep state
 *  possible.
 *
 *  The first goal is to enter STANDBY; if that is not appropriate
 *  given current conditions (e.g., the sleep transition latency is greater
 *  greater than the time until the next scheduled Clock event), then
 *  the secondary goal is the IDLE state; if that is disallowed (e.g., if
 *  the PowerCC26XX_DISALLOW_IDLE constraint is declared), then the policy
 *  will fallback and simply invoke WFI, to clock gate the CPU until the next
 *  interrupt.
 *
 *  In order for this policy to run, it must be selected as the Power
 *  Policy (either by being specified as the 'policyFxn' in the
 *  PowerCC26XX_Config structure, or specified at runtime with
 *  Power_setPolicy()), and the Power Policy must be enabled (either via
 *  'enablePolicy' in the PowerCC26XX_Config structure, or via a call to
 *  Power_enablePolicy() at runtime).
