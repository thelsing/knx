 *  @file       TRNGCC26XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      TRNG driver implementation for the CC26XX family
 *
 * @warning     This is a beta API. It may change in future releases.
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the TRNG_config
 *  struct.

 *  The CC26XX family has a dedicated hardware TRNG based on sampling multiple
 *  free running oscillators. With all FROs enabled, the TRNG hardware generates
 *  64 bits of entropy approximately every 5ms. The driver implementation
 *  chains multiple 64-bit entropy generation operations together to generate
 *  an arbitrary amount of entropy.
 *
 *  The driver implementation does not perform runtime checks for most input parameters.
 *  Only values that are likely to have a stochastic element to them are checked (such
 *  as whether a driver is already open). Higher input paramter validation coverage is
 *  achieved by turning on assertions when compiling the driver.
 *
