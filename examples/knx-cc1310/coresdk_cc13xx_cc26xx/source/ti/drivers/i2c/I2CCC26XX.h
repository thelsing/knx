 *
 *  @brief      I2C driver implementation for a CC26XX I2C controller.
 *
 *  # Driver Include #
 *  The I2C header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/I2C.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/i2c/I2CCC26XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref I2C.h for a complete description of APIs.
 *
 * # Overview #
 * The general I2C API is normally used in application code, e.g. I2C_open()
 * is used instead of I2CCC26XX_open(). The board file will define the device
 * specific config, and casting in the general API will ensure that the correct
 * device specific functions are called.
 * This is also reflected in the example code in [Use Cases](@ref I2C_USE_CASES).
 *
 * ## General Behavior #
 * Before using the I2C in CC26XX:
 *   - The I2C driver is initialized by calling I2C_init().
 *   - The I2C HW is configured and system dependencies are declared (e.g. IOs,
 *     power, etc.) by calling I2C_open().
 *   .
 * The following is true for receive operation:
 *   - RX is enabled by calling I2C_transfer().
 *     The readCount of the ::I2C_Transaction must be set to a non-zero value.
 *   - If the I2C_transfer() succeeds, the I2C remains enabled.
 *   - The application must check the return value from I2C_transfer()
 *     to verify that the transfer succeeded.
 *   .
 * The following apply for transmit operation:
 *   - TX is enabled by calling I2C_transfer().
 *     The writeCount of the ::I2C_Transaction must be set to a non-zero value.
 *   - If the I2C_transfer() succeeds, the I2C remains enabled.
 *   - The application must check the return value from I2C_transfer()
 *     to verify that the transfer succeeded.
 *   .
 * After I2C operation has ended:
 *   - Release system dependencies for I2C by calling I2C_close().
 *
 * ### Known Issue #
 * @warning The I2C may transmit a single data byte in the event that the
 * I2C slave address is not acknowledged (NACK'd). This is due to a known
 * hardware bug.
 *
 * ## Error handling #
 * If an error occurs during operation:
 *   - The I2C Master transmits a stop bit and remains enabled.
 *   .
 *
 * ## Power Management #
 *  The I2CCC26XX driver sets a power constraint during transactions to keep
 *  the device out of standby; so when all tasks are blocked, the device will
 *  enter idle mode instead of standby.  When the transactions have finished,
 *  the power constraint to prohibit standby is released.
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After I2C_open() call: I2C is enabled, there are no active I2C
 *      transactions, the device can enter standby.
 *    - After I2C_transfer() call: active I2C transactions exist, the device
 *      might enter idle, but not standby.
 *    - When I2C_transfer() completes, either after success or error, I2C
 *      remains enabled, and the device can enter standby.
 *    - After I2C_close() call: I2C is disabled
 *    - If the device goes into idle during a transaction, the state of
 *      SDA is undefined in the time between the transaction completing and
 *      the device waking up. SCL will go low until the device wakes up and
 *      starts another transaction or releases the bus. If this is a problem
 *      for another device on the I2C bus, you can set a power constraint for
 *      #PowerCC26XX_DISALLOW_IDLE before the transaction and release it
 *      when the transaction completes.
 *

 *  @brief  I2CCC26XX Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The baseAddr and intNum fields define the base address and the interrupt
 *  number of the I2C peripheral.  These values are passed to driverlib APIs
 *  and therefore must be populated by driverlib macro definitions.  These
 *  macros are found in the header files:
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - inc/hw_ints.h
 *
 *  The powerMngrId is the Power driver resource ID for the I2C peripheral.
 *  These macros are defined in PowerCC26XX.h

 *  intPriority is the I2C peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
 *  TI-RTOS kernel. This value is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *
 *  swiPriority is the priority of a TI-RTOS kernel Swi that the I2C driver
 *  creates to finalize I2C transfers. See the documentation for the
 *  ti.sysbios.knl.Swi module for a description of Swi priorities.
 *
 *  sdaPin and sclPin define the SDA and SCL pin mapping, respectively. These
 *  are typically defined with a macro in a header file, which maps to an
 *  IOID.  For example, CC1350_LAUNCHXL.h defines BOARD_I2C0_SDA0 to be IOID_5.
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  const I2CCC26XX_HWAttrsV1 i2cCC26xxHWAttrs[CC1350_LAUNCHXL_I2CCOUNT] = {
 *      {
 *          .baseAddr = I2C0_BASE,
 *          .powerMngrId = PowerCC26XX_PERIPH_I2C0,
 *          .intNum = INT_I2C_IRQ,
 *          .intPriority = ~0,
 *          .swiPriority = 0,
 *          .sdaPin = Board_I2C0_SDA0,
 *          .sclPin = Board_I2C0_SCL0,
 *      },
