 *  @file       AESCCMCC26XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      AESCCM driver implementation for the CC26XX family
 *
 * @warning     This is a beta API. It may change in future releases.
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the AESCCM_config
 *  struct.
 *
 *  # Hardware Accelerator #
 *  The CC26XX family has a dedicated hardware crypto accelerator. It is capable
 *  of multiple AES block cipher modes of operation including CCM. Only one operation
 *  can be carried out on the accerator at a time. Mutual exclusion is
 *  implemented at the driver level and coordinated between all drivers relying on
 *  the accelerator. It is transparent to the application and only noted to ensure that
 *  sensible access timeouts are set.
 *
 *  # Key Store #
 *  The CC26XX crypto module contains a key store. The only way to load a key into
 *  the AES accelerator is to first load it into the key store. To guarantee availability
 *  of open key locations in the key store for AES operations, the last two key
 *  locations (6 and 7) are reserved for ad-hoc operations. The key is loaded into the
 *  key store, the AES operation is carried out, and the key is deleted from the key store.
 *  Since the key store does not have retention and the keys can not survive going into
 *  standby, the key store is only used to load keys into the AES accelerator rather
 *  than store keys. Support for pre-loading keys into the key store and using them
 *  in an AES operation is not supported in this driver.
 *
 *  # Implementation Limitations
 *  - Only plaintext CryptoKeys are supported by this implementation.
 *  - This implementation does not support internal generation of IVs
 *
 *  # Runtime Parameter Validation #
 *  The driver implementation does not perform runtime checks for most input parameters.
 *  Only values that are likely to have a stochastic element to them are checked (such
 *  as whether a driver is already open). Higher input paramter validation coverage is
 *  achieved by turning on assertions when compiling the driver.
