Overview
========

The RF driver provides access to the radio core on the CC13xx/CC26xx device
family. It offers a high-level interface for command execution and to the
radio timer (RAT). The RF driver ensures the lowest possible power consumption
by providing automatic power management that is fully transparent for the
application.

@note This document describes the features and usage of the RF driver API. For a
detailed explanation of the RF core, please refer to the

Setup and configuration
=======================

The RF driver can be configured at 4 different places:

1. In the build configuration by choosing either the single-client or
   multi-client driver version.

2. At compile-time by setting hardware and software interrupt priorities
   in the board support file.

3. During run-time initialization by setting #RF_Params when calling
   #RF_open().

4. At run-time via #RF_control().


Build configuration
-------------------

The RF driver comes in two versions: single-client and multi-client. The
single-client version allows only one driver instance to access the RF core at
a time. The multi-client driver version allows concurrent access to the RF
core with different RF settings. The multi-client driver has a slightly larger
footprint and is not needed for many proprietary applications. The driver
version can be selected in the build configuration by linking either against a
RFCC26XX_singleMode or RFCC26XX_multiMode pre-built library. When using the
single-client driver, `RF_SINGLEMODE` has to be defined globally in the build
configuration. The multi-client driver is the default configuration in the
SimpleLink SDKs.


Board configuration
-------------------

The RF driver handles RF core hardware interrupts and uses software interrupts
for its internal state machine. For managing the interrupt priorities, it
expects the existence of a global #RFCC26XX_HWAttrsV2 object. This is
usually defined in the board support file, for example `CC1310_LAUNCHXL.c`,
but when developing on custom boards, it might be kept anywhere in the
application. By default, the priorities are set to the lowest possible value:

@code
const RFCC26XX_HWAttrsV2 RFCC26XX_hwAttrs = {
    .hwiPriority        = INT_PRI_LEVEL7,  // Lowest HWI priority:  INT_PRI_LEVEL7
                                           // Highest HWI priority: INT_PRI_LEVEL1

    .swiPriority        = 0,               // Lowest SWI priority:  0
                                           // Highest SWI priority: Swi.numPriorities - 1

    .xoscHfAlwaysNeeded = true             // Power driver always starts XOSC-HF:       true
                                           // RF driver will request XOSC-HF if needed: false
};
@endcode


Initialization
--------------

When initiating an RF driver instance, the function #RF_open() accepts a
pointer to a #RF_Params object which might set several driver parameters. In
addition, it expects an #RF_Mode object and a setup command which is usually
generated by SmartRF Studio:

@code
RF_Params rfParams;
RF_Params_init(&rfParams);
rfParams.nInactivityTimeout = 2000;

RF_Handle rfHandle = RF_open(&rfObject, &RF_prop,
        (RF_RadioSetup*)&RF_cmdPropRadioDivSetup, &rfParams);
@endcode

The function #RF_open() returns a driver handle that is used for accessing the
correct driver instance. Please note that the first RF operation command
before an RX or TX operation command must be a `CMD_FS` to set the synthesizer
frequency. The RF driver caches both, the pointer to the setup command and the
physical `CMD_FS` for automatic power management.


Run-time configuration
----------------------

While a driver instance is opened, it can be re-configured with the function
#RF_control(). Various configuration parameters @ref RF_CTRL are available.
Example:

@code
uint32_t timeoutUs = 2000;
RF_control(rfHandle, RF_CTRL_SET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT, &timeoutUs);
@endcode

<hr>
@anchor rf_command_execution
Command execution
=================

The RF core supports 3 different kinds of commands:

1. Direct commands
2. Immediate commands
3. Radio operation commands

Direct and immediate commands are dispatched via #RF_runDirectCmd() and
#RF_runImmediateCmd() respectively. These functions block until the command
has completed and return a status code of the type #RF_Stat when done.

@code
#include <ti/devices/${DEVICE_FAMILY}/driverlib/rf_common_cmd.h>

RF_Stat status = RF_runDirectCmd(rfHandle, CMD_ABORT);
assert(status == RF_StatCmdDoneSuccess);
@endcode

Radio operation commands are potentially long-running commands and support
different triggers as well as conditional execution. Only one command can be
executed at a time, but the RF driver provides an internal queue that stores
commands until the RF core is free. Two interfaces are provided for radio
operation commands:

1. Asynchronous: #RF_postCmd() and #RF_pendCmd()
2. Synchronous: #RF_runCmd()

The asynchronous function #RF_postCmd() posts a radio operation into the
driver's internal command queue and returns a command handle of the type
#RF_CmdHandle which is an index in the command queue. The command is
dispatched as soon as the RF core has completed any previous radio operation
command.

@code
#include <ti/devices/${DEVICE_FAMILY}/driverlib/rf_common_cmd.h>

RF_Callback callback = NULL;
RF_EventMask subscribedEvents = 0;
RF_CmdHandle rxCommandHandle = RF_postCmd(rfHandle, (RF_Op*)&RF_cmdRx,
        RF_PriorityNormal, callback, subscribedEvents);

assert(rxCommandHandle != RF_ALLOC_ERROR); // The command queue is full.
@endcode

Command execution happens in background. The calling task may proceed with
other work or execute direct and immediate commands to interact with the
posted radio operation. But beware that the posted command might not have
started, yet. By calling the function #RF_pendCmd() and subscribing events of
the type #RF_EventMask, it is possible to re-synchronize to a posted command:

@code
// RF_EventRxEntryDone must have been subscribed in RF_postCmd().
RF_EventMask events = RF_pendCmd(rfHandle, rxCommandHandle,
        RF_EventRxEntryDone);

// Program proceeds after RF_EventRxEntryDone or after a termination event.
@endcode

The function #RF_runCmd() is a combination of both, #RF_postCmd() and
#RF_pendCmd() and allows synchronous execution.

A pending or already running command might be aborted at any time by calling
the function #RF_cancelCmd() or #RF_flushCmd(). These functions take command
handles as parameters, but can also just abort anything in the RF driver's
queue:

@code
uint8_t abortGraceful = 1;

// Abort a single command
RF_cancelCmd(rfHandle, rxCommandHandle, abortGraceful);

// Abort anything
RF_flushCmd(rfHandle, RF_CMDHANDLE_FLUSH_ALL, abortGraceful);
@endcode

When aborting a command, the return value of #RF_runCmd() or #RF_pendCmd()
will contain the termination reason in form of event flags. If the command is
in the RF driver queue, but has not yet start, the #RF_EventCmdCancelled event is
raised.

<hr>
@anchor rf_event_callbacks
Event callbacks
===============

The RF core generates multiple interrupts during command execution. The RF
driver maps these interrupts 1:1 to callback events of the type #RF_EventMask.
Hence, it is unnecessary to implement own interrupt handlers. Callback events
are divided into 3 groups:

- Command-specific events, documented for each radio operation command. An example
  is the #RF_EventRxEntryDone for the `CMD_PROP_RX`.

- Generic events, defined for all radio operations and originating on the RF core.
  These are for instance #RF_EventCmdDone and #RF_EventLastCmdDone. Both events
  indicate the termination of one or more RF operations.

- Generic events, defined for all radio operations and originating in the RF driver,
  for instance #RF_EventCmdCancelled.

@sa @ref RF_Core_Events, @ref RF_Driver_Events.

How callback events are subscribed was shown in the previous section. The
following snippet shows a typical event handler callback for a proprietary RX
operation:

@code
void rxCallback(RF_Handle handle, RF_CmdHandle command, RF_EventMask events)
{
    if (events & RF_EventRxEntryDone)
    {
        Semaphore_post(rxPacketSemaphore);
    }
    if (events & RF_EventLastCmdDone)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
@endcode

In addition, the RF driver can generate error and power-up events that do not
relate directly to the execution of a radio command. Such events can be
subscribed by specifying the callback function pointers #RF_Params::pErrCb and
#RF_Params::pPowerCb.

All callback functions run in software interrupt (SWI) context. Therefore,
only a minimum amount of code should be executed. When using absolute timed
commands with tight timing constraints, then it is recommended to set the RF
driver SWIs to a high priority.
See @ref rf_setup_and_configuration "Setup and configuration" for more details.

<hr>
@anchor rf_power_management
Power management
================

The RF core is a hardware peripheral and can be switched on and off. The RF
driver handles that automatically and provides the following power
optimization features:

- Lazy power-up and radio setup caching
- Power-down on inactivity
- Deferred dispatching of commands with absolute timing


Lazy power-up and radio setup caching
-------------------------------------

The RF core optimizes the power consumption by enabling the RF core as late as
possible. For instance does #RF_open() not power up the RF core immediately.
Instead, it waits until the first radio operation command is dispatched by
#RF_postCmd() or #RF_runCmd().

The function #RF_open() takes a radio setup command as parameter and expects a
`CMD_FS` command to follow. The pointer to the radio setup command and the
whole `CMD_FS` command are cached internally in the RF driver. They will be
used for every proceeding power-up procedure. Whenever the client re-runs a
setup command or a `CMD_FS` command, the driver updates its internal cache
with the new settings.

By default, the RF driver measures the time that it needs for the power-up
procedure and uses that as an estimate for the next power cycle. On the
CC13x0/CC26x0 devices, power-up takes usually 1.6 ms. Automatic measurement
can be suppressed by specifying a custom power-up time with
#RF_Params::nPowerUpDuration. In addition, the client might set
#RF_Params::nPowerUpDurationMargin to cover any uncertainty when doing
automatic measurements. This is necessary in applications with a high hardware
interrupt load which can delay the RF driver's internal state machine
execution.


Power-down on inactivity
------------------------

Whenever a radio operation completes and there is no other radio operation in
the queue, the RF core might be powered down. There are two options in the RF
driver:

- **Automatic power-down** by setting the parameter
  #RF_Params::nInactivityTimeout. The RF core will then start a timer after
  the last command in the queue has completed. The default timeout is "forever"
  and this feature is disabled.

- **Manual power-down** by calling #RF_yield(). The client should do this
  whenever it knows that no further radio operation will be executed for a
  couple of milliseconds.

During the power-down procedure the RF driver stops the radio timer and saves
a synchronization timestamp for the next power-up. This keeps the radio timer
virtually in sync with the RTC even though it is not running all the time. The
synchronization is done in hardware.


Deferred dispatching of commands with absolute timing
-----------------------------------------------------

When dispatching a radio operation command with an absolute start trigger that
is ahead in the future, the RF driver defers the execution and powers the RF
core down until the command is due. It does that only, when:

1. `cmd.startTrigger.triggerType` is set to `TRIG_ABSTIME`

2. The difference between #RF_getCurrentTime() and `cmd.startTime`
   is at not more than 3/4 of a full RAT cycle. Otherwise the driver assumes
   that `cmd.startTime` is in the past.

3. There is enough time to run a full power cycle before `cmd.startTime` is
   due. That includes:

   - the power-down time (fixed value, 1 ms) if the RF core is already
     powered up,

   - the measured power-up duration or the value specified by
     #RF_Params::nPowerUpDuration,

   - the power-up safety margin #RF_Params::nPowerUpDurationMargin
     (the default is 282 microseconds).

If one of the conditions are not fulfilled, the RF core is kept up and
running and the command is dispatched immediately. This ensures, that the
command will execute on-time and not miss the configured start trigger.

<hr>
@anchor rf_rat
Accessing the Radio Timer (RAT)
==============================

The Radio Timer on the RF core is an independent 32 bit timer running at a
tick rate of 4 ticks per microsecond. It is only physically active while the
RF core is on. But because the RF driver resynchronizes the RAT to the RTC on
every power-up, it appears to the application as the timer is always running.
The RAT accuracy depends on the system HF clock while the RF core is active
and on the LF clock while the RF core is powered down.

The current RAT time stamp can be obtained by #RF_getCurrentTime():

@code
uint32_t now = RF_getCurrentTime();
@endcode

The RAT has 8 independent channels that can be set up in capture and compare
mode by #RF_ratCapture() and #RF_ratCompare() respectively. Three of these
channels are accessible by the RF driver. Each channel may be connected to
physical hardware signals for input and output or may trigger a callback
function.

In order to allocate a RAT channel and trigger a callback function at a
certain time stamp, use #RF_ratCompare():

@code
RF_Handle rfDriver;
RF_RatConfigCompare config;
RF_RatConfigCompare_init(&config);
config.callback = &onRatTriggered;
config.channel = RF_RatChannelAny;
config.timeout = RF_getCurrentTime() + RF_convertMsToRatTicks(1701);

RF_RatHandle ratHandle = RF_ratCompare(rfDriver, &config, nullptr);
assert(ratHandle != RF_ALLOC_ERROR);

void onRatTriggered(RF_Handle h, RF_RatHandle rh, RF_EventMask e, uint32_t compareCaptureTime)
{
    if (e & RF_EventError)
    {
        // RF driver failed to trigger the callback on time.
    }
    printf("RAT has triggered at %u.", compareCaptureTime);

    // Trigger precisely with the same period again
    config.timeout = compareCaptureTime + RF_convertMsToRatTicks(1701);
    ratHandle = RF_ratCompare(rfDriver, &config, nullptr);
    assert(ratHandle != RF_ALLOC_ERROR);
}
@endcode

The RAT may be used to capture a time stamp on an edge of a physical pin. This
can be achieved with #RF_ratCapture().

@code
#include <ti/drivers/pin/PINCC26XX.h>
// Map IO 26 to RFC_GPI0
PINCC26XX_setMux(pinHandle, IOID_26, PINCC26XX_MUX_RFC_GPI0);

RF_Handle rfDriver;
RF_RatConfigCapture config;
RF_RatConfigCapture_init(&config);
config.callback = &onSignalTriggered;
config.channel = RF_RatChannelAny;
config.source = RF_RatCaptureSourceRfcGpi0;
config.captureMode = RF_RatCaptureModeRising;
config.repeat = RF_RatCaptureRepeat;

RF_RatHandle ratHandle = RF_ratCapture(rfDriver, &config, nullptr);
assert(ratHandle != RF_ALLOC_ERROR);

void onSignalTriggered(RF_Handle h, RF_RatHandle rh, RF_EventMask e, uint32_t compareCaptureTime)
{
    if (e & RF_EventError)
    {
        // An internal error has occurred
    }
    printf("Rising edge detected on IO 26 at %u.", compareCaptureTime);
}
@endcode

In both cases, the RAT may generate an output signal when being triggered. The
signal can be routed to a physical IO pin:

@code
// Generate a pulse on an internal RAT output signal
RF_RatConfigOutput output;
RF_RatConfigOutput_init(&output);
output.mode = RF_RatOutputModePulse;
output.select = RF_RatOutputSelectRatGpo3;
RF_ratCompare(...);

// Map RatGpo3 to one of four intermediate doorbell signals.
// This has to be done in the override list in order to take permanent effect.
// The override list can be found in the RF settings .c file exported from
// SmartRF Studio.
// Attention: This will change the default mapping of the PA and LNA signal as well.
#include <ti/devices/[DEVICE_FAMILY]/inc/hw_rfc_dbell.h>
static uint32_t pOverrides[] =
{
    HW_REG_OVERRIDE(0x1110, RFC_DBELL_SYSGPOCTL_GPOCTL2_RATGPO3),
    // ...
}

// Finally, route the intermediate doorbell signal to a physical pin.
#include <ti/drivers/pin/PINCC26XX.h>
PINCC26XX_setMux(pinHandle, IOID_17, PINCC26XX_MUX_RFC_GPO2);
@endcode

<hr>
@anchor rf_tx_power
Programming the TX power level
==============================

The application can program a TX power level for each RF client with the function
#RF_setTxPower(). The new value takes immediate effect if the RF core is up and
running. Otherwise, it is stored in the RF driver client configuration.

TX power may be stored in a lookup table in ascending order. This table is usually
generated and exported from SmartRF Studio together with the rest of the PHY configuration.
A typical power table my look as follows:
@code
RF_TxPowerTable_Entry txPowerTable[] = {
    { .power = 11,  .value = { 0x1233, RF_TxPowerTable_DefaultPA }},
    { .power = 13,  .value = { 0x1234, RF_TxPowerTable_DefaultPA }},
    // ...
    RF_TxPowerTable_TERMINATION_ENTRY
};
@endcode

@note Some devices offer a high-power PA in addition to the default PA.
A client must not mix configuration values in the same power table and must
not hop from a default PA configuration to a high-power PA configuration unless it
can guarantee that the RF setup command is re-executed in between.

Given this power table format, the application may program a new power level in multiple
ways. It can use convenience functions to search a certain power level
in the power table or may access the table index-based:
@code
// Set a certain power level. Search a matching level.
RF_setTxPower(h, RF_TxPowerTable_findValue(txPowerTable, 17));

// Set a certain power level with a known level.
RF_setTxPower(h, txPowerTable[3].value);

// Set a certain power without using a human readable level.
RF_setTxPower(h, value);

// Set maximum power. Search the value.
RF_setTxPower(h, RF_TxPowerTable_findValue(txPowerTable, RF_TxPowerTable_MAX_DBM));

// Set minimum power without searching.
RF_setTxPower(h, txPowerTable[0].value);

// Set minimum power. Search the value.
RF_setTxPower(h, RF_TxPowerTable_findValue(txPowerTable, RF_TxPowerTable_MIN_DBM));

// Set maximum power without searching.
int32_t lastIndex = sizeof(txPowerTable) / sizeof(RF_TxPowerTable_Entry) - 2;
RF_setTxPower(h, txPowerTable[lastIndex].value);
@endcode

The current configured power level for a client can be retrieved by #RF_getTxPower().
@code
// Get the current configured power level.
int8_t power = RF_TxPowerTable_findPowerLevel(txPowerTable, RF_getTxPower(h));
@endcode

Convenience features
====================

The RF driver simplifies often needed tasks and provides additional functions.
For instance, it can read the RSSI while the RF core is in RX mode using the
function :tidrivers_api:`RF_getRssi`:

@code
int8_t rssi = RF_getRssi(rfHandle);
assert (rssi != RF_GET_RSSI_ERROR_VAL); // Could not read the RSSI

 *  The RF operation command must be compatible to the RF_Mode selected by RF_open(), e.g.
 *  proprietary commands can only be used when the RF core is configured for proprietary mode.
 *
 *  The returned command handle is an identifier that can be used to control command execution
 *  later on, for instance with RF_pendCmd() or RF_cancelCmd().
 *  It is a 16 Bit signed integer value, incremented on every new command.
 *  If the RF driver runs out of command containers, RF_ALLOC_ERROR is returned.
 *
 *  The priority \a ePri is only relevant in multi-client applications where commands of distinct
 *  clients may interrupt each other.
 *  Only commands started by RF_scheduleCmd() can preempt

 *  In single-client applications, \a ePri is ignored and should be set to ::RF_PriorityNormal.

 *
 *  - If TRIG_ABSTIME is used as a start trigger for the first command, TRIG_REL_FIRST_START
 *    can not be used for any other command. This is because the RF driver may insert a
