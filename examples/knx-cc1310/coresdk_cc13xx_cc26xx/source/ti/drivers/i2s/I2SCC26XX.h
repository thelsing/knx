 *  @brief  I2S Hardware attributes
 *
 *  intPriority is the I2S peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
 *  TI-RTOS kernel. This value is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *
 *  pinSD1 and pinSD0 define the SD0 and SD1 data pin mapping, respectively.
 *  pinSCK, pinMCLK and pinWS define the SCK, MCLK and WS clock pin mapping, respectively.
 *  All these pins are typically defined with a macro in a header file, which maps to an IOID.
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  const I2SCC26XX_HWAttrs i2sHWAttrs[CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL_I2SCOUNT] = {
 *      {
 *         .pinSD1      =  Board_I2S_ADI,
 *         .pinSD0      =  Board_I2S_ADO,
 *         .pinSCK      =  Board_I2S_BCLK,
 *         .pinMCLK     =  Board_I2S_MCLK,
 *         .pinWS       =  Board_I2S_WCLK,
 *         .intPriority =  ~0,
 *      },
 *  };
