 *
 *  @brief      ADCBuf driver implementation for a CC26X2 analog-to-digital converter
 *
 * # Driver include #
 *  The ADCBuf header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADCBuf.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/adc/ADCBufCC26X2.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 * # Overview #
 * This is a CC26X2 specific implementation of the generic TI-RTOS ADCBuf driver.
 * The generic ADCBuf API specified in ti/drivers/ADCBuf.h should be called by the application,
 * not the device specific implementation in ti/drivers/adcbuf/ADCBufCC26X2.
 * The board file defines the device specific configuration and casting in the general
 * API ensures the correct device specific functions are called. You should specify an
 * ADCBufCC26X2_ParamsExtension in the custom field of the ADCBuf_Params that suits
 * your application. The default settings work for many, but not all, usecases.
 *
 * # General Behavior #
 * A timer and the DMA are used to trigger the ADC and fill a buffer in the background (in hardware) at a specified frequency.
 * The application may execute other tasks while the hardware handles the conversions.
 * In contrast to the standard ti/drivers/ADC driver, this driver allows for precise sampling of waveforms.
 *
 * | Driver         | Number of samples needed in one call    |
 * |----------------|-----------------------------------------|
 * | ADC.h          | 1                                       |
 * | ADCBuf.h       | > 1                                     |
 *
 * This ADCBuf driver provides an API interface to using the analog-to-digital converter
 * directly from the CM3 without going through the sensor controller.
 * The sensor controller can still use the ADC, support for sharing the ADC resource between the
 * sensor controller and the CM3 is built into the driver. There is a hardware semaphore that the
 * driver must acquire before beginning any number of conversions. This same hardware semaphore also
 * prevents the simultaneous use of this driver and the basic ADC driver.
 *
 * The ADC drivers supports making between one and 1024 measurements once or continuous
 * measuring with returned buffer sizes between one and 1024 measurements.
 *
 * The application should call ADCBuf_init() once by the application to set the isOpened
 * flag to false, indicating that the driver is ready to use.
 *
 * The ADC driver is opened by calling ADCBuf_open() which will
 * set up interrupts and configure the internal components of the driver.
 * However, the ADC hardware or analog pins are not yet configured, since the sensor
 * controller or basic ADC driver might be using the ADC.
 *
 * In order to perform an ADC conversion, the application should call
 * ADCBuf_convert(). This call will request the ADC resource, configure the ADC, set up the DMA and GPTimer,
 * and perform the requested ADC conversions on the selected DIO or internal signal. The DIO or internal signal is defined by the
 * ADCBuf_Conversion structure in the application code and adcBufCC26x2Objects in the board file.
 *
 * @warning If the ADCBUF driver is setup in ADCBuf_RECURRENCE_MODE_CONTINUOUS mode, the user must assure that the provided callback
 *          function is completed before the next conversion completes. If the next conversion completes before the callback function finishes,
 *          the DMA will clobber the previous buffer with new data.
 *
 * If the sensor controller is using the ADC when the driver requests it at the start of the ADC_convert() call,
 * the conversion will fail and return false.
 * The ADC resource may be pre-acquired by calling the control function ADCBufCC26X2_CMD_ACQUIRE_ADC_SEMAPHORE.
 * It will be released again automatically after the next conversion completes.
 *
 * In both ADCBufCC26X2_SAMPING_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS mode and ADCBufCC26X2_SAMPING_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS mode, enough sampling
 * time must be provided between conversions that each measurement may be completed before the next trigger arrives.
 *
 * @note    The ADCBuf driver requires GPTimer0A to function correctly. It will be unavailable for other uses.
 *
 * # Supported ADC pins #
 * Below is a table of the supported ADC IO pins for each package size, for both CC26x2 and CC13x2.
 * It maps a DIO to its corresponding driverlib define for the CompBInput that it is hardwired to.
 * This table can be used to create virtual channel entries in the ADCBufCC26X2_adcChannelLut table in the board file.

 * Below is a table of internal signals that can be measured using the ADC.
 * Since we are not connecting to a DIO, there is no DIO to internal signal mapping. The DIO field in the channel lookup table should be marked PIN_UNASSIGNED.
 * This table can be used to create virtual channel entries in the ADCBufCC26X2_adcChannelLut table in the board file.

 *
 * # Error handling #
 * The following errors may occur when opening the ADC without assertions enabled:
 * - The ADC handle is already open.
 *
 * The following errors may occur when requesting an ADC conversion:
 * - The ADC is currently already doing a conversion.
 * - The ADC was not available (used by sensor controller or basic ADC).
 *
 *
 * # Power Management #
 * The TI-RTOS power management framework will try to put the device into the most
 * power efficient mode whenever possible. Please see the technical reference
 * manual for further details on each power mode.
 *
 * While converting, the ADCBufCC26X2 driver sets a power constraint to keep
 * the device out of standby. When the conversion has finished, the power
 * constraint is released. The driver also sets a dependency on the DMA to enable
 * background transfers from the ADC FIFO to memory.
 * The following statements are valid:
 *      - After ADCBuf_convert(): the device cannot enter standby.
 *      - After ADCBuf_convertCancel(): the device can enter standby again.
 *      - After a conversion finishes: the device can enter standby again.

 *  # Not Supported Functionality #
 *     - Performing conversions on multiple channels simultaneously is not supported.
 *       In other words, the parameter channelCount must always be set to 1 when calling ADCBuf_convert().
 *       The ADC on CC26XX devices does not support time-division multiplexing of channels or pins in hardware.
 *
 * # Use Cases #
 * ## Basic one-shot conversion #
 *  Perform one conversion on Board_ADCCHANNEL_A1 in ::ADCBuf_RETURN_MODE_BLOCKING.
 *  @code
 *      #include <ti/drivers/ADCBuf.h>
 *
 *      #define ADCBUFFERSIZE   100
 *
 *      ADCBuf_Handle adcBufHandle;

 *  - Using VDDS as a reference scales the upper range of the ADC with the battery voltage. As the battery depletes and its voltage drops, so does

 *  a function of the input voltage multiplied by the resolution in alternatives (not bits) divided by VDDS multiplied by a scaling factor derived
