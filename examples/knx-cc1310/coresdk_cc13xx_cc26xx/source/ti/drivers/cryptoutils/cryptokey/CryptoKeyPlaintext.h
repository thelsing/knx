/** ============================================================================
 *  @file       CryptoKeyPlaintext.h
 *
 * @warning     This is a beta API. It may change in future releases.
 *
 * # Overview #
 * This file contains the APIs to initialize and access plaintext CryptoKeys.
 * Plaintext CryptoKeys point to keying material stored in flash or RAM and
 * are not subject to enforced usage restrictions. That only means that calling
 * a function that requires an assymmetric public key with a symmetric key will
 * not return an error. It will likely not yield the desired results.
 *
 * # Usage #
 *
 * Plaintext keys are the simplest of the CryptoKeys. All they do is store the length
 * of and a pointer to the keying material. Their use is hence simple as well. After
 * calling the initialization function, the CryptoKey may be used in any of the
 * crypto operation APIs that take a CryptoKey as an input.
 *
 * @code
 *
 * uint8_t keyingMaterial[16];
 * CryptoKey cryptoKey;
 *
 * // Initialise the CryptoKey
 * CryptoKeyPlaintext_initKey(&cryptoKey, keyingMaterial, sizeof(keyingMaterial));
 *
 * // Use the CryptoKey in another crypto operation
 *
 * @endcode
 *
