/** ============================================================================
 *  @file       CryptoKey.h
 *
 * @brief The CryptoKey type is an opaque representation of a cryptographic key.
 *
 * @warning This is a beta API. It may change in future releases.
 *
 * Cryptographic keying material may be stored on an embedded system multiple ways.
 *  - plaintext: in plaintext in flash or RAM
 *  - keyblob: in encrypted form in flash or RAM
 *  - key store: in a dedicated hardware database whose entries can not be directly
 *    read out.
 *
 * Each storage option requires different approaches to handling the keying material
 * when performing a crypto operation. In order to separate these concerns from
 * the API of the various crypto drivers available with TI-RTOS, the CryptoKey
 * type abstracts away from these details. It does not contain any cryptographic
 * keying material itself but instead contains the details necessary for drivers to use the
 * keying material. The driver implementation handles preparing and moving the keying
 * material as necessary to perform the desired crypto operation.
 *
 * The same CryptoKey may be passed to crypto APIs of different modes subject to
 * restrictions placed on the key by their storage types. Plaintext keys may be used
 * without restriction while key store and keyblob keys have their permitted uses
 * restricted when the keying material is loaded or the keyblob is encrypted respectively.
 * These restrictions are specified in a CryptoKey_SecurityPolicy that is device-specific
 * and depends on the hardware capability of the device.
 *
 * An application should never access a field within a CryptoKey struct itself.
 * Where needed, helper functions are provided to do so.
 *
 * Before using a CryptoKey in another crypto API call, it must be initialized
 * with a call to one of the initialization functions.
 *  - CryptoKeyPlaintext_initKey()
 *  - CryptoKeyPlaintext_initBlankKey()
 *  - CryptoKeyKeyStore_initKey()
 *  - CryptoKeyKeyStore_initBlankKey()
 *  - CryptoKeyKeyBlob_initKey()
 *  - CryptoKeyKeyBlob_initBlankKey()
 *
 * The keyblob and keystore CryptoKeys may be used to create a keyblob or
 * load a key into a key store after their respective _init call.
 *
 * CryptoKeys can be initialized "blank", without keying material but with an empty buffer
 * or key store entry, to encode the destination of a key to be created in the
 * future. This way, keys may be generated securely within a key store
 * for example and never even be stored in RAM temporarily.
 *
 * Not all devices support all CryptoKey functionality. This is hardware-dependent.
