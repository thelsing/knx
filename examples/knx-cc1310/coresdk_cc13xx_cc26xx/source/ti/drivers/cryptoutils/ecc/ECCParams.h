 *  @brief Enumeration of curve equations supported.
 *
 *  Elliptic curves can be expressed using multiple equations of polynomials over
 *  finite fields.
 *  All forms can be converted to one another using parameter substitution.
 *  Each curve has a default curve equations it was designed to use.
 *
 *  Some curve implementations have restrictions on which algorithms and schemes
 *  they work with. For example, Curve25519 was explicitely designed with ECDH in mind.
 *  It only uses and yields the X coordinate of a point on the elliptic curve in common
 *  implementations. Some implementations do provide X and Y affine coordinates but most
 *  do not.
 *  Therefore, ECDSA and ECJPAKE do not have compatible implementations
 *  for Curve25519 on some devices as the Y coordinate is required by them.
 *
 *  Check the header files of each device-specific implementation for information
 *  regarding curve-support for specific schemes on a device.
