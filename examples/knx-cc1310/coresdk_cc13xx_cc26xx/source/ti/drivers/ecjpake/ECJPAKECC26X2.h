 *
 *  @brief      ECJPAKE driver implementation for the CC26X2 family
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the ECJPAKE_config
 *  struct.
 *
 *  # Hardware and Implementation Details #
 *
 *  The CC26X2 family has a dedicated public key accelerator.
 *  It is capable of multiple mathematical operations including dedicated ECC point addition, doubling,
 *  and scalar multiplication. Only one operation can be carried out on the accelerator
 *  at a time. Mutual exclusion is implemented at the driver level and coordinated
 *  between all drivers relying on the accelerator. It is transparent to the application
 *  and only noted ensure sensible access timeouts are set.
 *
 *  The large number maths engine (LNME) uses a dedicated 2kB block of RAM (PKA RAM) for its operations.
 *  The operands of the maths operations must be copied into and results out of the PKA ram.
 *  This necessitates a significant number of reads and writes for each operation.
 *  The bus interface to the RAM only allows for word-aligned reads and writes. The CPU splits
 *  the reads and writes from and to general SRAM from unaligned addresses into multiple
 *  bus operations while accumulating the data in a register until it is full.
 *  The result of this hardware process is that providing buffers such as plaintext CryptoKey
 *  keying material to ECC APIs that are word-aligned will significantly speed up the operation and
 *  reduce power consumption.
 *
 *  The driver implementation does not perform runtime checks for most input parameters.
 *  Only values that are likely to have a stochastic element to them are checked (such
 *  as whether a driver is already open). Higher input paramter validation coverage is
 *  achieved by turning on assertions when compiling the driver.
 *
 *  # Supported Curve Types #
 *
 *  The driver implementation supports the following curve types for ECJPAKE:
 *
 *  | Curve Type        | Supported |
 *  |-------------------|-----------|
 *  | Short Weierstrass | Yes       |
 *  | Montgomery        | No        |
 *  | Edwards           | No        |
 *
 *  # Public Key Validation #
 *
 *  When performing Schnorr-ZKP verification, the foreign public key will always be validated.
 *  The public V is validated implicitly during the operation.
 *  The implementation assumes that the cofactor, h, of the curve is 1. This lets us
 *  skip the computationally expensive step of multiplying the foreign key by the order and
 *  checking if it yields the point at infinity. When the cofactor is 1, this property is
 *  implied by validating that the point is not already the point at infinity and that it
 *  validates against the curve equation.
 *  All curves supplied by default, the NIST and Brainpool curves, have cofactor = 1. While
 *  the implementation can use arbitrary curves, you should verify that any other curve used
 *  has a cofactor of 1.
