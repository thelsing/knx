 *
 *  @brief      Generic AESCTRDRBG implementation based on the AESCTR driver
 *
 *  @warning     This is a beta API. It may change in future releases.
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the AESCTR_config
 *  struct.
 *
 *  # Use of AESCTR #
 *  This implementation uses the AESCTR driver to generate the random bitstream
 *  required to mutate the internal AESCTRDRBG state and provide random output
 *  bits. The driver will open an instance of the AESCTR driver based on the index
 *  specified in #AESCTRDRBGXX_HWAttrs:aesctrIndex. Mutual exclusion and hardware
 *  access are all handled by the AESCTR driver instance.
 *
 *  # Implementation Limitations
 *  - Only plaintext CryptoKeys are supported by this implementation.
 *
 *  # Runtime Parameter Validation #
 *  The driver implementation does not perform runtime checks for most input parameters.
 *  Only values that are likely to have a stochastic element to them are checked (such
 *  as whether a driver is already open). Higher input paramter validation coverage is
 *  achieved by turning on assertions when compiling the driver.

/*! @brief Define that specifies the maximum AES key length required
 *
 *  This define defines what the largest AES key length used in an application is.
 *  Since this implementation needs to support all AES key lengths by default,
 *  temporary buffers and the internal driver state are sized to accomodate AES-256.
 *  If only AES-128 is used in an application, the driver can be recompiled
 *  with a different #AESCTRDRBG_MAX_KEY_LENGTH to save RAM in the #AESCTRDRBGXX_Object
 *  and reducing stack size requirements.
